# Software Testing Project

This project is a Java-based application for software testing, utilizing Jenkins and Bitbucket for continuous integration (CI) and version control. It includes application logic, test cases, and a Maven configuration for managing dependencies and build tasks.

---

## **Project Structure**

### **Root Directory**
- **`.github`**: Contains workflows for CI/CD.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control.
- **`pom.xml`**: Maven configuration file for project dependencies and build processes.
- **`src/`**: Contains application and test code.

### **`src/` Directory**
- **`main/java`**: Holds the primary application logic (`Main.java`).
- **`test/java`**: Contains test cases (`TestMain.java`) to validate the application.

---

## **Tools Used**

### **1. Jenkins**
- Automates the build, test, and deployment process.
- Triggers builds and tests on every commit or pull request to Bitbucket.

### **2. Bitbucket**
- Manages version control and collaboration.
- Stores the repository and integrates with Jenkins for CI/CD.

### **3. Maven**
- Handles project dependencies, build lifecycle, and test execution.

### **4. Testing Framework**
- Likely uses JUnit (or a similar framework) for writing and running test cases.

---

## **Flow of Activities**

### **1. Development**
- The core logic of the application is implemented in `Main.java`.
- Test cases are written in `TestMain.java` to validate the functionality of the application.

### **2. Version Control**
- Changes are committed to the Bitbucket repository.
- Branching strategies (e.g., `feature` and `main` branches) are followed for collaborative development.

### **3. Continuous Integration (CI)**
- Jenkins monitors the Bitbucket repository for changes.
- On detecting a commit or pull request:
  1. **Build Step**:
     - Jenkins uses Maven to build the project.
  2. **Test Step**:
     - Unit tests in `TestMain.java` are executed.
  3. **Result Step**:
     - Jenkins reports the success or failure of the build and tests.

### **4. Deployment (Optional)**
- Once tests pass, the application can be deployed (if configured in Jenkins).

## **How to Run the Project Locally**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- Jenkins (optional, for local CI testing)

### **2. Build and Run**
- Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/project
  ```
- Compile the application:
  ```bash
  mvn compile
  ```
- Run the application:
  ```bash
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="main.java.Main"
  ```

### **3. Run Tests**
- Execute test cases:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

---

## **Outputs**
- **Test Reports**: Generated by Maven and visible in the console or saved in the `target` directory.
- **Build Logs**: Captured by Jenkins during CI/CD.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add integration tests for end-to-end validation.
- Configure Jenkins to deploy successful builds to a staging environment.
- Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployments.
